# NapocaBike

NapocaBike is a project developed as part of my undergraduate degree. It's focused on assisting cyclists in Cluj-Napoca to find essential locations like parking areas, shops, and bike rentals. This project marked my first experience with the .NET framework, specifically ASP.NET Core, and it integrates GPS tracking, multiple Google APIs, and interactive maps.

## Technologies Used

- [ASP.NET Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet): The web framework used for building the application.
- [Google APIs](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation): Used for map integration and location services.
- [GPS Tracking](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/location): Used for real-time location tracking of the users.
